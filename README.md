This is a simple implementation of Yao's Protocol: in this case, the two parties (Alice and Bob) jointly compute the sum of a set of values.  
The detailed description of the code and the repository can be found in the file "Anna_Nava_implementation_documentation.pdf".  
"circuit.jpg" contains the imagine of the utilised circuit, a 4-bit full adder.  
Python files come from https://github.com/ojroques/garbled-circuit: they have been properly modified for this particular implementation.  
Both "Alice_inputs.txt" and "Bob_inputs.txt" contain a set of numbers which will be summed by the Protocol.
